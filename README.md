# ForemWebView - iOS

This is the WKWebView customization that powers the Forem (coming soon) and [DEV](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/DEV-ios) mobile apps.

## Requirements

The Project supports iOS 13.x but features like Picture in Picture are only available for iPhones on iOS 14.x

## Installation

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler. Once you have your Swift package set up, adding ForemWebView as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/forem/ForemWebView-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

#### Carthage & CocoaPods

We've moved to supporting SPM and not Carthage or CocoaPods. If interested in contributing, PRs to support these are welcome!

## Usage

After importing the framework into your project you can initialize the ForemWebView like you would any other WKWebView (Storyboard, programmatically, etc). This custom `WKWebView` implementation will handle it's own `WKNavigationDelegate`, so instead of implementing this logic yourself please rely on the provided `ForemWebViewDelegate` for callbacks.

We have two *deep dive* documents:
- [ForemWebView deep dive](/docs/ForemWebView-deep-dive.md) is a walkthrough of the capabilities available when you're using the Framework in your project
- [Native Bridge deep dive](/docs/native-bridge-deep-dive.md) documents the native interface used to communicate between the Web (DOM + JS) and Swift contexts

#### Important notes:
- Using SwiftUI? [We would appreciate your feedback after trying out the framework](https://github.com/forem/ForemWebView-ios/issues/4).
- If your project requires more detailed access to `WKNavigationDelegate` callbacks [please add a feature request](https://github.com/forem/ForemWebView-ios/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

## Contributing

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/forem/ForemWebView-ios/issues).

For Pull Requests:
1. Fork and clone the project.
1. Create a branch, naming it either a feature or bug: git checkout -b feature/that-new-feature or bug/fixing-that-bug
1. Code and commit your changes. Bonus points if you write a [good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): git commit -m 'Add some feature'
1. Push to the branch: git push origin feature/that-new-feature
1. Create a pull request for your branch üéâ

#### Project Tests

The tests are run using the Example app bundled in the project. You can use XCode to run the test suite or from a Terminal with the following command:

```bash
# Make sure the `destination` param is using an iOS/Simulator available in your local environment
set -o pipefail && xcodebuild -scheme ForemWebView -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=14.2,name=iPhone 12 Pro Max' test | xcpretty
```
